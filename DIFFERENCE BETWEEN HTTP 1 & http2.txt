    HTTP is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol used by World Wide Web developed by Tim Berners Lee and his team between 1989-1991.
It has gone through various developments though maintaining its simplicity while shaping its flexibility.

HTTP/1.1

	The first standardized version of HTTP,HTTP/1.1 was published in early 1997.
Features:

*Connection could be reused which saves time,not necessary to open multiple times to display the embedded resources.
*Pipelining was added
*Chunked encoding were supported
*Additional cache control mechanism were introduced.
*Content negotiation,including language,encoding and type was introduced where client and sever could  agree on which content to exchange.

HTTP/2
	Over the years web pages became complex.More visual media content and user interactivity increased.In 2010,Google introduced  an experimental protocol SPDY 
which increased responsiveness and laid a foundation for HTTP/2.In 2015,HTTP/2 was introduced to solve many problems that HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate.It was much
 faster and more efficient.

HTTP/2 differs from HTTP/1.1 in the following ways

*It is a binary protocol which can't be read and created manually.
*It allows for the implementation of  improved optimization techniques
*It is a multiplexed protocol where several requests can be made through same connection
*It compresses headers thus removes duplication and overhead of data transmitted

	Officially standardized in May 2015, HTTP/2 was incredibly successful. High-traffic websites showed the most rapid adoption in an effort to save on data transfer
 overhead and subsequent budgets.This rapid adoption was likely because HTTP/2 didn't require changes to websites and applications. To use it, only an up-to-date server 
that communicated with a recent browser was necessary. Only a limited set of groups was needed to trigger adoption, and as legacy browser and server versions were renewed,
 usage was naturally increased, without significant work for web developers.
